## Notes

My first money-maker project is made with Wordpress. So I love it. I made a lot of project with Wordpress.

- Easy-to-use
- Best for fast production
- Theme switching is easier than others
- No need any versioning. So easy deployment If you don't need versioning.
- A lot of ready to use theme, plugin, code snippet
- It's market leader: Wordpress' market share is 43.1% in 2022
