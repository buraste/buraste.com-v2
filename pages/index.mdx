# buraste's garden ðŸª´

Welcome to my personal digital garden! I use here for taking notes and saving my important bookmarks.

I believe: Sharing is caring! So I publish them for everyone that want to learn more.

If you want to know more about me, ðŸ‘‰ [check out about me page](https://buraste.com/about-me/).

## Getting started

This garden is quite literally my digital brain. It includes my thoughts, notes and links on topics I care about.

I update the notes weekly. The content being markdown files found here, which after every commit to the GitHub repo builds the website using Docusaurus and publishes it to [garden.buraste.com](https://garden.buraste.com) from which you are likely reading this page.

The way I structure each page often looks the same and follows a structure. The sidebar you see on the left is sorted alphabetically. It's nested too. Many top level folders are nested quite deep. For example take programming languages, it's top level folder (you can see all the folders and structure of them here).

## Content Structure

As mentioned, I like to keep a sort of structure for pages. It's roughly:

1. Title with optional description to describe topic.
2. My thoughts on the topic.
3. Subtopics - Various subtopics related to the main topic.
4. Notes - Notes on the topic as well as things I found interesting on the internet regarding the topic. I often give a link of where I got things from.
5. Code - Code snippets.
6. Links - Links related to the topic.
