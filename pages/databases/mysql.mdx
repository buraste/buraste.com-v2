# MySQL

## Code Snippets

- Key buffer errors:

```
Increase Key Buffer ( yours is currently 64MB, but total indexes are 116M, so put at least 128MB). Should help immediately.
	2.	Run mysqloptimize and mysqlrepair on your tables
	3.	Increase table cache/ decrease total number of tables to increase the table cache hit rate. Maybe you've got some unused or old tables which could be deleted.
Other recommended confugration options:
	•	log_slow_queries = /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
	•	long_query_time = 4
	•	log-queries-not-using-indexes
Check log file after some time.
```
